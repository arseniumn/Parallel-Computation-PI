# Parallel-Computation-Pi
The mathematical constant pi is computed using Java with 2 implementations : 1) Multithreading and 2) Sockets (Server-Client message passing). The algorithm divides the work in blocks between the threads and each thread calculates it.
The mathematical formula that is used to calculate pi is :
